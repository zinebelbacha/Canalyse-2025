### Canalyse 2025

**Project Description:**  

The Canalyse 2025 project aims to develop a web platform specialized in collecting and analyzing the issues encountered during the Africa Cup of Nations organized in Morocco. The primary objective of this initiative is to extract and synthesize relevant information to prevent the recurrence of these issues during the 2030 FIFA World Cup, also planned to be held in Morocco. This report provides a detailed overview of the activities conducted and the results achieved by each team involved in the execution of this project, highlighting the joint efforts and steps taken to meet the set objectives.  

**Project Structure:**  

The project is organized into several main directories:  

* **Back_end:** This directory contains the source code for the web application's back-end, including the database, APIs, and management scripts.  
* **DATA_ML:** This directory contains the data and machine learning analysis scripts used to extract and synthesize information from the collected data.  
* **Front_end:** This directory contains the source code for the web application's front-end, including the user interface and JavaScript scripts.  
* **images_du_site:** This directory contains the images used in the web application.  

**Important Files:**

* `README.md`: This file contains a description of the project and instructions for installing and using the web application.  
* `manage.py`: This Python script is used to manage the back-end of the web application.  
* `index.html`: This HTML file is the entry point of the web application.  
* `analyses_des_donees.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the machine learning analysis scripts used to extract and synthesize information from the collected data.  
* `code_pour_simuler_data.py`: This Python script is used to generate simulated data for developing and testing the web application.  
* `data_simule.csv`: This CSV file contains the simulated data generated by the script `code_pour_simuler_data.py`.  
* `heatmap_tendance_problemes.html`: This HTML file displays a heatmap representing the trend of issues encountered over time.
* `model.py`: This Python script contains the machine learning model used to extract and synthesize information from the collected data.
